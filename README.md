### Font (important)
The Persian font used in production (`YekanBakh`) is NOT included in this repository due to licensing. Please purchase it from FontIran and place the file at `app/fonts/YekanBakh-VF.woff2`. You can also use any alternative font.

Note: The local font is referenced in `app/layout.tsx` via `next/font/local`. If you change the font name/path, update that file accordingly.

### Development

Prereqs: Node.js 18+ and pnpm

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

### Build & Deploy

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Deploy anywhere (e.g., Vercel). The configuration is standard.

### Roadmap
- Keyboard shortcuts (Rotate/Crop/Download)
- Undo/Redo
- Annotation tools
- More export presets

### Contributing 🤝
PRs and issues are welcome. Please follow clean TypeScript conventions (clear naming, no dead code, keep UX consistent).
